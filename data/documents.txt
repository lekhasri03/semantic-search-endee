Arrays are used to store multiple elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations.
Stacks follow the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle and are used in function calls and undo operations.
Queues follow the First In First Out (FIFO) principle and are commonly used in scheduling algorithms.
Linked lists consist of nodes connected using pointers and allow dynamic memory allocation.
Binary search works only on sorted arrays and reduces time complexity to O(log n).
Linear search checks each element one by one and works on both sorted and unsorted data.
Hashing allows fast data retrieval using key-value pairs and provides average O(1) lookup time.
A hash table stores data in an associative manner using hash functions.
Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes with parent-child relationships.
Binary trees allow each node to have at most two children.
Binary Search Trees maintain elements in sorted order for efficient searching.
Heaps are complete binary trees commonly used to implement priority queues.
Graphs consist of vertices and edges and are used to represent networks.
Depth First Search explores graph nodes by going as deep as possible before backtracking.
Breadth First Search explores graph nodes level by level.
Dynamic programming solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems.
Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices to find a global solution.
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
Object-Oriented Programming is based on concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Encapsulation restricts direct access to data and improves security.
Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties of another class.
Polymorphism allows methods to behave differently based on the object calling them.
Databases store structured data and support efficient querying.
SQL is used to interact with relational databases using structured queries.
Indexes improve database query performance by reducing search time.
Operating Systems manage hardware resources and provide services to applications.
Process scheduling determines the order in which processes are executed by the CPU.
Deadlock occurs when processes wait indefinitely for resources held by each other.
Virtual memory allows execution of processes that are not completely in physical memory.
